Solving real-world AI/ML/DL &amp; Generative AI problems I encounter across the web — from broken chatbots to flawed model logic. Analyze. Fix. Learn


# 🤖 Real-World AI & ML Problem Solver

This project documents **real-world AI, ML, DL, and Generative AI problems** I discover while browsing websites, using apps, or exploring products that claim to be powered by artificial intelligence.

Instead of ignoring poorly designed bots or broken ML logic, I **analyze the issue, propose a fix, and share what I’ve learned**.

## 🔍 What’s in this repo?

- 🧠 **ML/DL/GenAI Issues** – Poor implementations, hallucinating chatbots, slow inference, weak prompt handling, etc.
- 📊 **Root Cause Analysis** – Dive into why these issues likely happen
- 💡 **Proposed Solutions** – Improvements, better model suggestions, prompt engineering fixes, or architecture changes
- 💻 **Code Snippets** – Where needed, example scripts, model configs, or prompt tuning

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- 🤖 Chatbot problems (bad UX, misaligned responses, hallucinations)
- 🧠 Prompt engineering issues in LLMs
- 📉 Model deployment flaws (latency, scaling, etc.)
- 📦 Broken pipelines or misuse of models
- ⚠️ Ethical or misleading AI usage
